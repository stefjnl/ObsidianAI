# Chat Attachments Feature - Fix Summary

## Issue Resolution

**Problem:** 404 error when attempting to upload attachments via `POST /conversations/{id}/attachments`

**Root Cause:** The minimal API endpoint was using `IFormFile file` parameter binding, which doesn't work correctly with ASP.NET Core minimal APIs for file uploads without additional configuration.

## Solution Applied

Changed the endpoint signature from using direct `IFormFile` parameter binding to manual form reading via `HttpRequest`:

### Before:
```csharp
app.MapPost("/conversations/{id:guid}/attachments", async (
    Guid id,
    IFormFile file,
    AddAttachmentToConversationUseCase useCase,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken) => { ... })
```

### After:
```csharp
app.MapPost("/conversations/{id:guid}/attachments", async (
    Guid id,
    HttpRequest request,
    AddAttachmentToConversationUseCase useCase,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken) =>
{
    if (!request.HasFormContentType)
    {
        return Results.BadRequest("Request must have multipart/form-data content type.");
    }

    var form = await request.ReadFormAsync(cancellationToken).ConfigureAwait(false);
    var file = form.Files.GetFile("file");

    if (file == null || file.Length == 0)
    {
        return Results.BadRequest("No file uploaded.");
    }
    // ... rest of validation and processing
})
```

## Changes Made

### API Layer
**File:** `ObsidianAI.Api\Configuration\EndpointRegistration.cs`
- Modified the POST `/conversations/{id:guid}/attachments` endpoint to use `HttpRequest` parameter instead of `IFormFile`
- Added explicit content type validation
- Added explicit file existence validation
- Maintained all existing file size and type validations

### Web Layer
**File:** `ObsidianAI.Web\Components\Shared\AttachmentUploader.razor`
- Fixed async/await warning in `DownloadAttachment` method by returning `Task.CompletedTask`

## Verification

### Tests
- All 15 unit tests pass ✅
- Build succeeds without errors ✅

### Manual Testing
Created test conversation and successfully uploaded attachment:
```bash
# Create conversation
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5095/conversations" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Test Conversation"}'
# Response: {"id":"244eb8d4-c956-462d-94bc-c059c9a3060c"}

# Upload attachment
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5095/conversations/244eb8d4-c956-462d-94bc-c059c9a3060c/attachments" \
  -F "file=@test-attachment.txt"
# Response: HTTP 201 Created with attachment metadata

# List attachments
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5095/conversations/244eb8d4-c956-462d-94bc-c059c9a3060c/attachments"
# Response: [{"id":"a801bf72-...","filename":"test-attachment.txt",...}]
```

## Feature Status

✅ **Completed:**
- Domain Layer: Attachment entity, IAttachmentRepository port
- Application Layer: AttachmentDto, AttachmentMapper, AddAttachmentToConversationUseCase
- Infrastructure Layer: AttachmentRepository, database migration
- API Layer: POST and GET endpoints for attachments (NOW WORKING)
- Web Layer: AttachmentUploader component, UI integration
- Testing: All unit tests passing

## Attachment Context Integration (Latest Update)

### Problem
After fixing the 404 upload issue, attachments were being stored in the database but the AI couldn't access them. The AI would respond saying it couldn't read the files.

### Solution
Extended the chat pipeline to fetch attachments and include their content as context:

1. **Domain Layer**: Extended `ChatInput` to include `Attachments` property with new `AttachmentContent` record
2. **API Layer**: Modified `/chat/stream` endpoint to fetch attachments from the database before processing
3. **Application Layer**: Added `FormatMessageWithAttachments` helper that prepends attachment content to user messages in a structured format:
   ```
   [ATTACHED FILES - These files are provided as context for analysis]
   
   File: data.json (.json)
   --- BEGIN FILE CONTENT ---
   {file content here}
   --- END FILE CONTENT ---
   
   [USER MESSAGE]
   {user's actual message}
   ```

### How It Works
When a user sends a message with attachments:
1. Attachments are uploaded and stored via POST `/conversations/{id}/attachments`
2. When the user sends a chat message, the API fetches all attachments for that conversation
3. Attachment content is prepended to the user's message before sending to the AI agent
4. The AI receives the full context and can analyze/reference the attached files

## Next Steps for Full Integration

1. ✅ Attachments upload working
2. ✅ Attachments integrated into AI context
3. Test the feature end-to-end in the Blazor UI
4. Implement download functionality for attachments
5. Consider adding attachment preview/viewing capabilities
6. Add attachment metadata to conversation export
7. Consider adding ability to remove individual attachments

## Technical Notes

### Why the Fix Works

Minimal APIs in ASP.NET Core handle parameter binding differently than controller-based APIs. For file uploads:
- Direct `IFormFile` binding can fail without proper model binding configuration
- Using `HttpRequest.ReadFormAsync()` gives explicit control over form parsing
- This approach works reliably with multipart/form-data content from various clients

### Clean Architecture Alignment

The fix maintains clean architecture principles:
- Domain remains pure (Attachment entity, ports)
- Application layer handles business logic (use cases)
- Infrastructure implements data persistence
- API layer handles HTTP concerns (form parsing, status codes)
- Web layer manages UI interaction
