# Filesystem MCP Integration - Quick Start ✅

## Status: Implementation Complete, Ready for Testing

---

## What Was Implemented

✅ **Docker MCP Gateway** managing multiple stdio-based MCP servers  
✅ **Single HTTP Endpoint** (`http://localhost:8033/mcp`) for all servers  
✅ **Automated Setup Script** for configuration  
✅ **Comprehensive Documentation** with troubleshooting guides  
✅ **Security Controls** via allowed directory list  

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Configuration Already Created ✅

Configuration files are in place:
- `C:\Users\sjsla\.docker\mcp\config.yaml`
- `C:\Users\sjsla\.docker\mcp\registry.yaml`

**Allowed Directories:**
- `C:\temp`
- `C:\Users\Public\Documents`

### 2. Application is Running ✅

```
Aspire Dashboard: https://localhost:17055
```

### 3. Next: Verify in Dashboard

1. Open https://localhost:17055 (already accessible)
2. Check `mcp-gateway` resource status
3. Review logs for:
   ```
   Loaded server: obsidian
   Loaded server: filesystem
   ```

---

## Architecture

```
Docker MCP Gateway (:8033)
  ├─ Obsidian Server (stdio)
  └─ Filesystem Server (stdio)
       │
       └─ Allowed Directories:
          • C:\temp
          • C:\Users\Public\Documents
```

**Key Design:**
- Single gateway process manages both servers
- stdio→HTTP translation handled by gateway
- Application sees unified HTTP endpoint
- Tools automatically routed to correct server

---

## Testing Checklist

### Already Done ✅
- [x] Configuration files created
- [x] Allowed directories validated
- [x] Application builds successfully
- [x] Aspire starts without errors
- [x] No endpoint creation failures
- [x] Dashboard accessible

### To Verify
- [ ] Gateway shows "Running" in dashboard
- [ ] Both servers loaded successfully
- [ ] Tools appear in catalog
- [ ] Filesystem operations work
- [ ] Security boundaries enforced

## Documentation Reference

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `docker-mcp-gateway-setup.md` | Complete setup and troubleshooting guide |
| `filesystem-mcp-corrected.md` | Implementation details and architecture |
| `filesystem-mcp-test-results.md` | Test execution results |
| `setup-mcp-gateway.ps1` | Automated configuration script |

## Common Tasks

### Update Allowed Directories
```powershell
# Edit config file
notepad $env:USERPROFILE\.docker\mcp\config.yaml

# Restart application
cd c:\git\ObsidianAI\ObsidianAI.AppHost
dotnet run
```

### Add Obsidian Vault
```yaml
# In config.yaml, update:
ALLOWED_DIRECTORIES: "C:\\temp;C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents;G:\\My Drive\\obsidian-vault"
```

### Re-run Setup
```powershell
.\setup-mcp-gateway.ps1 -AllowedDirectories @("C:\temp", "G:\My Drive\obsidian-vault")
```

## What Changed from Original Plan

### ❌ Original (Failed)
- Attempted to run filesystem server via `npx`
- Tried to use `.WithHttpEndpoint()` on stdio process
- Got error: "Could not create Endpoint object"

### ✅ Corrected (Success)
- Use Docker MCP Gateway for stdio→HTTP
- Single gateway manages both servers
- No custom HTTP wrapper needed
- Clean Aspire integration

---

## Key Files Modified

1. **ObsidianAI.AppHost/AppHost.cs**
   - Changed from separate gateways to single multi-server gateway
   - Removed npx executable approach
   - Updated to use `--servers obsidian,filesystem`

2. **ObsidianAI.Web/appsettings.json**
   - Added `McpServers` configuration section
   - Both servers use same endpoint
   - Gateway handles routing

3. **Docker MCP Config** (created)
   - `~/.docker/mcp/config.yaml` - Server configurations
   - `~/.docker/mcp/registry.yaml` - Enabled servers list

---

## Security Notes

✅ **Access Control Active**
- Only configured directories accessible
- Paths outside list are blocked
- Current allowed:
  - `C:\temp`
  - `C:\Users\Public\Documents`

⚠️ **Before Production**
- Update Obsidian API key in config.yaml
- Review and adjust allowed directories
- Remove test directories if not needed
- Monitor file access logs
